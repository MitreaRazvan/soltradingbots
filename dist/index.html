Interested in purchasing freshly launched tokens on the Solana Network? Having

      if you haven't already, now would be the perfect opportunity to set up an account
      or explore alternative platforms. Without a trading bot, securing a new token
      can be challenging. It often takes time before tokens become accessible on
      platforms like Raydium or Jupiter. By the time they are available, you may
      have missed out on a prime entry opportunity.

Trojan Bot (Unibot on solana chain)
</h2> <p class="text-white">
Trojan Bot is a groundbreaking tool on the Solana blockchain that
            has been making waves with its innovative features and
            lightning-fast transactions. In this Trojan Bot review, we’ll
            explore its great features and why it has become the go-to choice
            for traders seeking a competitive edge in the market.
<br> <br><span class="font-bold text-xl">Introduction</span> <br>
Trojan has rapidly emerged as a dominant force in the Solana ecosystem,
            achieving remarkable milestones in a short span of time. With over $100M
            in daily volume and an impressive $850M+ in total volume since its inception,
            Trojan has solidified its position as one of the top Solana trading bots
            in the crypto space. Having a daily user base of 25,000 active traders,
            Trojan’s success is a testament to the exponential growth of the Solana
            blockchain.
<br> <br><span class="font-bold text-xl">Benefits of Using Trojan Bot</span> <br><br>
1.<span><a href="https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-mitrea004">Trojan</a></span> represents a significant leap forward, delivering a trading experience
            that is both seamless and user-friendly, directly through Telegram. Born
            from the ambition to empower users with state-of-the-art trading functionalities
            and excellent UX through Telegram.

2. Basic Buy/Sell Orders: <span><a href="https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-mitrea004">Trojan</a></span> allows users to place buy and sell orders directly through their Telegram
            Bot. Users can specify the token they want to buy or sell, the amount
            they wish to trade, and the desired price level.
<br> <br>
3. Limit Orders: With <span><a href="https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-mitrea004">Trojan</a></span>, users can set limit orders to execute trades at specific price
            levels. This feature enables traders to enter the market at their
            desired prices, helping them minimizing the need for constant
            monitoring.
<br> <br>
4. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Orders: DCA orders enable users to automate
            their investment strategy by regularly purchasing a specified amount
            of a particular token over time, regardless of price fluctuations. Trojan
            allows users to set up DCA orders, helping them accumulate assets gradually
            and potentially reduce the impact of market volatility Copy Trading:
            Trojan offers copy trading functionality, allowing users to copy-trade

            and trade assets across both ecosystems seamlessly. The bridge enables
            users to swap Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20) with Solana-based tokens
            (SPL) and vice versa, expanding their trading opportunities and access
            to different blockchain networks.
<br><br>

            at pump.fun, just paste the contract address you find in pump.fun to
<span><a href="https://t.me/solana_trojanbot?start=r-mitrea004">Trojan</a></span> to trade them.

            bots give access to exactly the same Trojan wallet, token positions,

Maestrobot offers a Telegram-based tool that automates the buying and
          selling of crypto tokens and most importantly allows its users to
          snipe tokens early. It’s engineered for traders who aim to capitalize
          on the market’s swift movements, providing features that allow for
          immediate token purchase upon liquidity addition, sales with a single
          button press, and the deployment of complex trading strategies.
<br> <br><span class="font-bold text-xl">Features</span> <br>
Key Features of Maestro Sniper Bot
<br><br>
Basic swaps → normal token contract address buy and sells
<br><br>
Auto buying → Maestro Sniper Bot has integration to multiple Telegram call
          channels, and you can setup autobuys for these calls
<br><br>
Sniping → Sniping, or God Mode, is a tool kit that covers every possible
          token launch situation
<br><br>
Sniping presales → If you wish to snipe a hyped presale (for example sniping
          a Pinksale presale) Maestrobot sniper offers a very easy interface for
          it
<br><br>
Copy-trade → Allows you to copy the buys and sells of tracked wallets at
          amazing speeds
<br><br>
Rug pull → Prevents liquidity fraud and other suspicious actions. The bot
          attempts to sell assets before a malicious transaction is processed, protecting
          investments
<br><br>
Anti-MEV → Hides transactions through a private relay to avoid MEV bots
          and copy traders, increasing security but potentially slowing down processing
<br><br>
Intelligent Slippage → Automatically adjusts slippage based on market conditions
          and price impact, not recommended for high-risk operations
<br><br>
Multi-Wallet → Allows purchasing from multiple wallets, complicating the
          copying of transactions by others
<br><br>
Max Gas Price → Sets a maximum gas price limit for transactions
<br><br>
Default Slippage → Sets a fixed slippage percentage for transactions without
          automatic adjustment
<br><br>
Gas Limit → Limits the maximum gas fee in dollars per transaction
<br><br>
Disabling Security Mode → Allows purchasing tokens despite detected risks
          or suspicious activity, ignoring warnings
<br> <br><span class="font-bold text-xl">The four most important buttons on the setting menu:</span> <br> <br>
✅ Auto Buy = If you want the bot to auto buy immediately when the tracked
          wallet performs a buy transaction, you NEED to enable Auto Buy here and
          in your wallet settings (two locations).
<br><br>
✏️ Buy Amount = This serves as the maximum allowed auto buy amount. For
          example, if you set Buy Amount to 0.5 BNB and the tracked wallet buys 0.1
          BNB, then the bot will also buy 0.1 BNB, matching the tracked wallet. However,
          if the tracked wallet buys any amount LARGER than 0.5 BNB, the bot will
          still only buy 0.5 BNB.
<br><br>
✅ Frontrun = This controls whether you would like to frontrun the tracked
          wallet’s buys and sells. Enabling Frontrun means that the bot will use
          higher gwei than the tracked wallet to get ahead of it.
<br><br>
✅ Blind Follow = The bot excludes transactions that don’t originate from
          the tracked address (fake/real airdrops, contract traders, multi-wallet
          transactions, etc.).
<br><br>
✏️Gas Price/Delta -✏️Slippage — 🌐Smart Slippage = These buttons allow
          you to override your wallet gas, slippage, and Smart Slippage settings
          for copytrade Auto Buys.
<br><br> <br><span class="font-bold text-xl">Security</span> <br>
