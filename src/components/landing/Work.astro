          <br />
          <br /><span class="font-bold text-xl">Features</span>
          <br />
          Key Features of Maestro Sniper Bot
          <br /><br />
          Basic swaps → normal token contract address buy and sells
          <br /><br />
          Auto buying → Maestro Sniper Bot has integration to multiple Telegram call
          channels, and you can setup autobuys for these calls
          <br /><br />
          Sniping → Sniping, or God Mode, is a tool kit that covers every possible
          token launch situation
          <br /><br />
          Sniping presales → If you wish to snipe a hyped presale (for example sniping
          a Pinksale presale) Maestrobot sniper offers a very easy interface for
          it
          <br /><br />
          Copy-trade → Allows you to copy the buys and sells of tracked wallets at
          amazing speeds
          <br /><br />
          Rug pull → Prevents liquidity fraud and other suspicious actions. The bot
          attempts to sell assets before a malicious transaction is processed, protecting
          investments
          <br /><br />
          Anti-MEV → Hides transactions through a private relay to avoid MEV bots
          and copy traders, increasing security but potentially slowing down processing
          <br /><br />
          Intelligent Slippage → Automatically adjusts slippage based on market conditions
          and price impact, not recommended for high-risk operations
          <br /><br />
          Multi-Wallet → Allows purchasing from multiple wallets, complicating the
          copying of transactions by others
          <br /><br />
          Max Gas Price → Sets a maximum gas price limit for transactions
          <br /><br />
          Default Slippage → Sets a fixed slippage percentage for transactions without
          automatic adjustment
          <br /><br />
          Gas Limit → Limits the maximum gas fee in dollars per transaction
          <br /><br />
          Disabling Security Mode → Allows purchasing tokens despite detected risks
          or suspicious activity, ignoring warnings

          <br />
          <br /><span class="font-bold text-xl"
            >The four most important buttons on the setting menu:</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          ✅ Auto Buy = If you want the bot to auto buy immediately when the tracked
          wallet performs a buy transaction, you NEED to enable Auto Buy here and
          in your wallet settings (two locations).
          <br /><br />
          ✏️ Buy Amount = This serves as the maximum allowed auto buy amount. For
          example, if you set Buy Amount to 0.5 BNB and the tracked wallet buys 0.1
          BNB, then the bot will also buy 0.1 BNB, matching the tracked wallet. However,
          if the tracked wallet buys any amount LARGER than 0.5 BNB, the bot will
          still only buy 0.5 BNB.
          <br /><br />
          ✅ Frontrun = This controls whether you would like to frontrun the tracked
          wallet’s buys and sells. Enabling Frontrun means that the bot will use
          higher gwei than the tracked wallet to get ahead of it.
          <br /><br />
          ✅ Blind Follow = The bot excludes transactions that don’t originate from
          the tracked address (fake/real airdrops, contract traders, multi-wallet
          transactions, etc.).
          <br /><br />
          ✏️Gas Price/Delta -✏️Slippage — 🌐Smart Slippage = These buttons allow
          you to override your wallet gas, slippage, and Smart Slippage settings
          for copytrade Auto Buys.
