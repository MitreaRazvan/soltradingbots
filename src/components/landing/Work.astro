            tokens on various blockchains.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="font-bold text-xl">Setting Up Filters </span>
            <br /><br />
            To effectively snipe meme coins, it’s crucial to set up the right filters.
            Here’s how:
            <br /><br />
            Quick Buy Options: Enable quick buy for rapid purchases. For example,
            you can set it to buy tokens worth $10 instantly.
            <br /><br />
            Liquidity Filters: Set minimum liquidity requirements to avoid low-liquidity
            tokens. A good starting point is around $1,000.

            <br /><br />
            Security Filters: Filter out tokens without proper security features
            like mint authority and LP burned status.
            <br /><br />
            Market Cap Filters: Adjust market cap filters to target smaller, potentially
            high-growth tokens. For example, you might want to look for tokens with
            a total market cap of around $20,000.
            <br /><br />
            <span class="font-bold text-xl">Trading on solana</span>
            <br /><br />
            To snipe meme coins on Solana using BullX: Switch to Solana: Focus on
            Solana by turning off other blockchains in BullX.
            <br /><br />
            Check New Pairs: Use the “New Pairs” section to identify new tokens on
            Solana. Sell <br /><br />
            Apply Filters: Ensure you have the appropriate filters in place to find
            promising tokens.

            price drops by a certain percentage.

          <h2 class="text-white text-2xl font-bold">Maestro Sniper Bot</h2>
          <p class="text-white">
            Maestrobot offers a Telegram-based tool that automates the buying
            and selling of crypto tokens and most importantly allows its users
            to snipe tokens early. It’s engineered for traders who aim to
            capitalize on the market’s swift movements, providing features that
            allow for immediate token purchase upon liquidity addition, sales
            with a single button press, and the deployment of complex trading
            strategies.
            <br />
            <br /><span class="font-bold text-xl">Features</span>
            <br />
            Key Features of Maestro Sniper Bot
            <br /><br />
            Basic swaps → normal token contract address buy and sells
            <br /><br />
            Auto buying → Maestro Sniper Bot has integration to multiple Telegram
            call channels, and you can setup autobuys for these calls
            <br /><br />
            Sniping → Sniping, or God Mode, is a tool kit that covers every possible
            token launch situation
            <br /><br />
            Sniping presales → If you wish to snipe a hyped presale (for example
            sniping a Pinksale presale) Maestrobot sniper offers a very easy interface
            for it
            <br /><br />
            Copy-trade → Allows you to copy the buys and sells of tracked wallets
            at amazing speeds
            <br /><br />
            Rug pull → Prevents liquidity fraud and other suspicious actions. The
            bot attempts to sell assets before a malicious transaction is processed,
            protecting investments
            <br /><br />
            Anti-MEV → Hides transactions through a private relay to avoid MEV bots
            and copy traders, increasing security but potentially slowing down processing
            <br /><br />
            Intelligent Slippage → Automatically adjusts slippage based on market
            conditions and price impact, not recommended for high-risk operations
            <br /><br />
            Multi-Wallet → Allows purchasing from multiple wallets, complicating
            the copying of transactions by others
            <br /><br />
            Max Gas Price → Sets a maximum gas price limit for transactions
            <br /><br />
            Default Slippage → Sets a fixed slippage percentage for transactions
            without automatic adjustment
            <br /><br />
            Gas Limit → Limits the maximum gas fee in dollars per transaction
            <br /><br />
            Disabling Security Mode → Allows purchasing tokens despite detected risks
            or suspicious activity, ignoring warnings

            <br />
            <br /><span class="font-bold text-xl"
              >The four most important buttons on the setting menu:</span
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            ✅ Auto Buy = If you want the bot to auto buy immediately when the tracked
            wallet performs a buy transaction, you NEED to enable Auto Buy here and
            in your wallet settings (two locations).
            <br /><br />
            ✏️ Buy Amount = This serves as the maximum allowed auto buy amount. For
            example, if you set Buy Amount to 0.5 BNB and the tracked wallet buys
            0.1 BNB, then the bot will also buy 0.1 BNB, matching the tracked wallet.
            However, if the tracked wallet buys any amount LARGER than 0.5 BNB, the
            bot will still only buy 0.5 BNB.
            <br /><br />
            ✅ Frontrun = This controls whether you would like to frontrun the tracked
            wallet’s buys and sells. Enabling Frontrun means that the bot will use
            higher gwei than the tracked wallet to get ahead of it.
            <br /><br />
            ✅ Blind Follow = The bot excludes transactions that don’t originate
            from the tracked address (fake/real airdrops, contract traders, multi-wallet
            transactions, etc.).
            <br /><br />
            ✏️Gas Price/Delta -✏️Slippage — 🌐Smart Slippage = These buttons allow
            you to override your wallet gas, slippage, and Smart Slippage settings
            for copytrade Auto Buys.
            <br /><br />
